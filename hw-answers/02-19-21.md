## Unit 25, I.1-4, II.2, 4

### I
1. οὔποτε ἀσφαλῆ τὰ μεγάλα.  
Great things are never safe.

2. πρῶτος ηὕρου ταύτην τὴν τίμην.  
You first found this honor [for yourself]. (less literally, "You were the first to find this honor [for yourself].")

3. ἄφρων ἐστὶν οὗτος, ὃς ἑαυτῷ δοκεῖ πάντα δύνασθαι.  
The one who seems to himself to be able [to do] all things is foolish.

4. οὐδεὶς τούτους τοὺς ἄνδρας ἀξίως τῶν καλῶν πράξεων ἐπαινεῖν δυνήσεται.  
No one will be able to praise those men [in a manner] worthy of their noble deeds.

### II

2. Wise men say that human beings ought to help one another, and so we do this.  
οἱ σοφοί φασι τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ὠφελεῖν ἀλλήλους χρῆναι, ὥστε τοῦτο ποιοῦμεν.

4. By the fact that you fled, fellow soldiers, you made the battle bitter for yourselves and sweet for the enemy.  
ἐκ τοῦ φυγεῖν / τῷ φυγεῖν / διά τὸ φυγεῖν (etc.), στρατιῶται (ἄνδρες), τὴν μάχην πίκραν ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς καὶ ἡδείαν τοῖς πολεμίοις ἔθεσαν / ἐποιήσατε.
