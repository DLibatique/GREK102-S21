## Unit 28, I.1-3, 7-8

**NOTE**: Sentences with participles are notoriously flexible and can be translated in many different ways. My answers below are just my interpretations! - Prof. L

### I

\1. ταῦτα εἰπὼν οὐχ ἁμαρτήσῃ.  
You will not make a mistake in saying these things. / You will not say these things in error.

\2. ὁ νεανίας κακῶς ἔχει· οὔποτε γὰρ ἀνέχεται δεύτερος ὤν.  
The young man is doing badly *[see bottom of p. 103 for ἔχω + adverb]*, for he never puts up with being second.

\3. ἔτυχε γυμναζόμενος ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ.  
He happened to be in training on that day. / By chance, he was in training on that day.

\7. οὐκ οἶσθα τὸν θάνατον παύσοντα καὶ τοὺς καλῶς πράττοντας καὶ τοὺς μή;  
Don't you know that death will stop both those who do well and those who don't?

\8. οὐδένα χρὴ ὀργίζεσθαι τοῖς ἑλομένοις τὴν ἡμετέραν πόλιν ἀντὶ τῆς ἑτέρας· οὗτοι γὰρ οὐχ ἥμαρτον τῶν ἐλπίδων, οὐδ‘ ἠγνόησαν οὐδὲν οὔτε τῶν ἀγαθῶν οὔτε τῶν κακῶν ἃ ἔχει ἑκατέρα τῶν δυνάμεων.  
It is necessary that no one be angry at those who took our city instead of the other (city), for those people were not mistaken in their hopes, nor were they ignorant at all *[οὐδέν used as adverbial accusative, p. 142]* of the good things or bad things which each of the powers has.
