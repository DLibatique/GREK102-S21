## Unit 35, I.2; II.4, 9; Unit 36, II.2-3

## Unit 35

### I

2. If we accuse them, they will not agree with us readily.  
ἐὰν αὐτῶν κατηγορήσωμεν, ἡμῖν οὐκ ὁμολογήσουσι ῥᾳδίως.

### II

4. εἰ τάχιστα δράμοις, ἴσως ἂν τὸν κίνδυνον φύγοις.  
If you should run very quickly, perhaps you would escape the danger.

9. εἰ μὴ οἱ πεντήκοντα ἱππῆς ἐκώλυσαν, διέβησαν ἂν οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι εἰς ταύτην τὴν χώραν καὶ στρατόπεδον ἂν ἐποιήσαντο ὑπὸ τοῖς πρὸς ἑσπέραν ὄρεσι τῆς πόλεως.  
If the fifty cavalary men had not prevented (it), the Lacedaemonians would have crossed into this land and made a camp below the mountains to the west of the city (or, "the western mountains of the city").

## Unit 36

### II

2. τότε μὲν οὐδεὶς ἄν παρὰ τῶν πολεμίων δῶρα ἔλαβεν, νῦν δὲ πᾶς τις δήπου ζητεῖ προδότης γενέσθαι.    
At that time, no one would have taken gifts from the enemies, but now, everyone surely seeks to become a traitor.

3. δεινὰ οἱ πολῖται ἔπασχον· καὶ γὰρ αἱ γυναῖκες τὰ παιδία καὶ τοὺς ἄνδρας οἴκοι λιποῦσαι εἰς τὸ ὄρος ἄλλαι ἄλλοθεν ἔτρεχον.  
The citizens were suffering terrible things; for in fact, the women, after they left their children and husbands at home, were running to the mountain, different women from different directions.  
\* When you see two ἀλλο- forms next to one another, it often indicates a difference between the activities of "one"/"some" and "other(s)"/"some", so here, ἄλλαι ἄλλοθεν can be translated in various ways: "some women from one direction, some from another direction"; "different women from different directions"; "different women from different directions"; etc.
