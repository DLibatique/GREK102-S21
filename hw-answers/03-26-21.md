## Unit 34, IV.1-4

### IV

1. τοῦ νεανίου ἐρομένου ἥντινα τῶν τριῶν θυγατέρων συμφέροι γῆμαι, γελῶντες ἀπεκρινάμεθα ὅτι ἀγνοοῖμεν.  
When the young man asked which of the three daughters it was advantageous to marry, we, laughing, replied that we didn't know.

2. ἐῶμεν τὸν βασιλέα πολιορκοῦντα τὸ ἄστυ διαμένειν, ἢ βοηθήσωμεν;  
Should we allow the king to continue beseiging the town, or should we come to (their) aid?  

3. ἀκούσατε, ὦ ἄνδρες (τάχα γὰρ ἂν αὐτὸ βούλοισθε πυθέσθαι)· ὁ Καλλίας τί βουλόμενος ἐκεῖνα ἔπραξεν;  
Listen, men (for you may want to learn this); with what intention (literally, "wanting what") did Kallias do those things?

4. ἠρώτων οἱ στρατιῶται πῶς εὐεργετοῖεν τὸν Κῦρον, οὐκ ἐξὸν στρατεύεσθαι ἄνευ χρημάτων· οὐ γὰρ ἠξίουν πείθεσθαι στρατηγῷ ἔλαττον ἢ ὑπέσχετο δαπανῶντι.  
The soldiers were asking how they (should) show kindness to Cyrus, since it was not possible to march out on campaign without money; for they did not think it proper to obey a general who spent less than he promised.
