## Unit 30, III.1-4

### III

1. τρισὶ δ' ἡμέραις ὕστερον τὴν ἑαυτῶν ἀρετὴν αὖθις ἐδήλωσαν ὠφελοῦντες τοὺς ἀποροῦντας σιτίων.  
Three days later, they showed their excellence again in/by helping those who lacked food.

2. οὐ μνήμονες ὄντες, ὦ ἄνδρες στρατιῶται, φαίνεσθε οὔτε τῶν τότε γενομένων οὔτε τῶν νῦν μελλόντων γενήσεσθαι.  
Fellow soldiers (see "fellow" in English-Greek glossary), you are clearly not mindful (see uses of φαίνω on p. 249) of either the things that happened then or the things that are about to happen now.

3. οὕτω δεινὸς λέγειν ἦν οὗτος ὁ πονηρὸς ὥστε φαίνεσθαι ἄξιος εἶναι ἀρχῆς.  
That evil man was so clever at speaking (see p. 135) that he seemed to be worthy of ruling.

4. πρῶτον μὲν ἡσυχίαν ἦγεν ὁ γέρων ταῦτα ὁρῶν πραττόμενα ὑπὸ τῶν ἐπιβουλευόντων τοῖς ἄρχουσιν, τελευτῶν δὲ τοῖς πολίταις πάντα ἀπέδειξεν ὡς παύσων τὴν στάσιν.  
First, the old man was quiet (literally, "was leading his leisure time") while he was watching those things being done by the ones plotting against the rulers, but he finally (see p. 260) revealed everything to the citizens to stop (future participle) the strife.
