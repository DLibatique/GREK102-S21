## Unit 25, I.7, 10; II.3, 5

### I

7. τούτῳ τῷ τρόπῳ οἱ Ἀθηναῖοι ἰσχυρὰ καὶ μεγάλα ἐν ὀλίγῳ χρόνῳ ἐποίησαν τὰ τείχη, ὥστε οἱ Λακεδαιμόνιοι οὐκέτι ἐπιτίθεσθαι αὐτοῖς ἐδύναντο.  
In this way, the Athenians built [lit., "made"] the walls strong and great in a short time, so that the Spartans [lit., "Lacedaimonians"] were no longer able to attack them.

10. ὁ μὲν πατὴρ φίλιός τε καὶ χαρίεις ἦν ὥσθ‘ ὑπὸ πάντων φιλεῖσθαι, τῶν δὲ δύο ὑέων ἑκάτερος ἑκάτερον πολλὰ κακὰ λέγει ὥσθ‘ ὑπὸ μηδενὸς ἐπαινεῖσθαι.  
The father was friendly and charming so that he was loved by all, but each of his two sons says many bad things about the other so that they are praised by no one.

### II

3. We seem to ourselves to be so virtuous that no one surpasses us.  
δοκοῦμεν ἡμῖν αὐτοῖς οὕτως ἀγαθοὶ εἶναι ὥστε μηδένα ἡμῶν διαφέρειν.

5. For four days the sailors were able to prevent the hoplites from boarding [the ship], but on the fifth day a few fell ill, so that it was necessary for them to surrender themselves.  
τέτταρας μὲν ἡμέρας οἱ ναῦται κωλύειν τοὺς ὁπλίτας ἀναβαινεῖν ἐδύναντο, τῇ δὲ πέμπτῃ (ἡμέρᾳ) ὀλίγοι ἐνόσησαν ὥστε παραδοῦναι ἑαυτοὺς χρῆν / ἔδει.
