### III

1. ἐν ἐκεῖνῳ τῷ πολέμῳ ἄλλα τε δεινὰ ἐγένετο ἐν ταῖς μάχαις καὶ Ἀλκαῖος ὁ ποιητὴς αὐτὸς μὲν ἐξέφυγε, τὴν δ‘ ἀσπίδα ἔλιπεν, οἱ δ‘ Ἀθηναῖοι αὐτὴν ἔλαβον καὶ τοῖς θεοῖς ἀνέθεσαν.  
In that war, other terrible things happened in the battles, and Alcaeus, the poet himself, escaped, but he left (behind his) shield, and the Athenians took it and dedicated it to the gods.

2. οἵδε μὲν ἐκ παντὸς τρόπου βούλονταί με τῇ δίκῃ ἁλῶναι, ὑμεῖς δ‘ μὴ παράγεσθε τοῖς ψευδέσι λόγοις ἀλλ‘ ἀεὶ ζητεῖτε διαγνῶναι τοὺς ἀληθῶς δικαίους καὶ τοὺς ἀδίκους.  
These people wish by every conceivable means that I be caught in the trial, but you all, don't be led astray by their lying words, but always seek to determine those who are truly just and those who are unjust.
