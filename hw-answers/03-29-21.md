## Unit 35, I.1, II.1, 7 (I.2, II.2 if we cover future conditionals on Friday)

### I

1. The men whom(ever) Socrates examined by conversing with (them) appeared to those present to know nothing, with the result that they were angry with him.  
οἱ ἄνδρες οὕστινας διαλέγων ὁ Σωκράτης ἐλέγχοι ἐφαίνοντο τοῖς παροῦσιν μηδὲν εἰδέναι, ὥστε τούτῳ ὠργίζοντο.
* note that μηδέν is used here rather than οὐδέν because the negation belongs with the infinitive εἰδέναι rather than the verb of the apodosis ἐφαίνοντο; we would use οὐ in the latter case

### II

1. ὅστις ἄν πρέσβεις ἀδικῇ, εἰ μὴ αὐτίκα ἀλλὰ τέλος δίκην δίδωσιν.  
Whoever wrongs ambassadors pays a price, if not immediately, at least in the end (adverbial accusative).

7. πρέπει ἀεὶ ποιεῖν ὅ τι ἂν παραινέσωσιν οἱ σοφοί.  
It is always fitting to do what(ever) (the) wise people advise.

## If we cover future conditionals ...

### I

2. If we accuse them, they will not agree with us readily.  
ἐὰν αὐτῶν κατηγορήσωμεν, ἡμῖν οὐκ ὁμολογήσουσι ῥᾳδίως.

### II

2. ἐὰν οἱ τρεῖς ἀδελφοὶ λάθωσι κλέψαντες τὰ ὅπλα ἃ ἀνέθεσαν οἱ Θηβαῖοι, πλούσιοι γενήσονται καίπερ ἀνόσια πράξαντες.  
If the three brothers secretly steal the weapons that the Thebans dedicated, they will become rich, even though they do profane things.
