Grading in this course will be slightly unorthodox. Every student will begin the semester with a **point total** of 0. Then, every assignment that you complete in the areas of homework, quizzes, exams, translations, compositions, and external events will add points to your total. Your point total across all categories at the end of the semester will determine the semester grade that you receive, and you get to decide what combination of assignments and assessments will get you to your desired final grade. You choose the grade that you want, and you are in control of drawing your own pathway to get there.

Because there will be a number of pathways to get to the minimum point total for an A (925 points), **every assignment is optional**. This includes **everything**: homework, quizzes, exams, translations, compositions, external events. As such, if you don’t submit an assignment by its indicated due date, I will simply assume that you have opted not to complete it and I won’t chase you down for it. If you intend to complete an assignment but anticipate difficulty in meeting its deadline, **please be proactive and contact me before it’s due**. I am extremely flexible with granting extensions, especially in the current pandemic atmosphere, but I can’t grant an extension that isn’t asked for! I reserve the right to deduct points from any assignment submitted late without prior notification or discussion.

### Homework (5 points per assignment)
There will be **thirty-six (36) homework assignments** throughout the semester. Each will be assessed in terms of completeness, rather than correctness. A fully completed homework assignment submitted on time will be awarded 5 full points. All homework assignments can be submitted through Canvas.

### Quizzes (30 points per quiz)
There will be **ten (10) weekly quizzes** throughout the semester, except on weeks with exams (see below). Each quiz will have a maximum total of 30 points, and it will be graded traditionally. Each quiz will cover the material from the previous week in class. All quizzes will be open-note, open-resource, and open-Internet, and there will be no time limit. Each quiz will be available through Canvas on the Friday afternoon of any given week, and it will be due by the beginning of the class the following Monday, unless otherwise noted.

### Exams (100 points per exam)
There will be **three (3) exams** throughout the semester. Each exam will have a maximum total of 100 points, and it will be graded traditionally. Each exam will cover the material in its respective third of the course; this means that exams 2 and 3 will focus on material from the middle and last third of the course respectively, but each will draw on material that you learned previously. Each exam will be open-note, open-resource, and open-Internet, and there will be no time limit. Each exam will be available through Canvas; all dates of availability and due dates will be listed in the course schedule below.

### Translation Projects (30 points per project)
There will be **four (4) translation projects** throughout the semester that will ask you to translate a longer passage of ancient Greek and answer grammatical questions about it. Each will be appropriately adapted for the grammar and vocabulary that you will have encountered by its due date, and there will be ample hints and vocabulary help with each passage. I will grade each project traditionally. Each translation project will be available through Canvas, and its due date will be listed in the course schedule below.

### Composition Projects (30 points per project)
There will be **four (4) composition projects** throughout the semester that will ask you to compose a passage of ancient Greek according to guidelines and suggestions that I will supply. Each will be appropriately levelled for the grammar and vocabulary that you will have encountered by its due date. I will grade each composition project on a specification basis: that means that I will give it a grade of either satisfactory (full credit, 30/30) or unsatisfactory with a provisional grade (i.e., 20/30). A satisfactory grade means that there are few to no errors in your Greek and that you have followed most or all of the prompts in the assignment. If you receive an unsatisfactory, you will have unlimited attempts to revise your submission according to my suggestions until it gets a grade of satisfactory. If you opt not to revise, your provisional grade will stand. Each composition project will be available through Canvas, and its due date will be listed in the course schedule below.

### External Events and Assignments (various point totals)
Throughout the semester, there will be a number of completely optional events that you can attend and projects that you can complete that will earn you points outside of the structures of the assessments listed above. To be clear, you can easily meet the 925-point threshold for an A in the course without attending or completing any of these events or projects, but they aim at getting you to engage with the material of the course (ancient Greek language and culture) in outside-of-the-box ways -- they’ll be a lot of fun! Each opportunity will be advertised in advance, and undoubtedly, more will pop up, but here are some that are currently on the books:
* ***Hades Twitch streams.*** (At least) three times this semester, I’ll be streaming my playthroughs of the video game Hades on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/TheDancingGrad). It’s a fun roguelike game based on Greek mythology. If you attend and follow the instructions that I’ll talk about in the stream, you can earn some semester points!
* **Philoctetes** ***or*** **Oidipous Tyrannos** ***assignments***. Various assignments, including reader response sheets and reflection prompts based on translations of the Sophoclean plays *Philoctetes* and *Oidipous Tyrannos*, will be assigned throughout the semester with point totals to be determined.
* **Philoctetes** ***Discussion with Prof. Emily Austin***. Prof. Emily Austin of the University of Chicago will be visiting with our class at 4pm (EST) on Thursday, March 18, to discuss the play *Philoctetes* and the themes of isolation and solitude (unfortunately timely themes for the current environment). If you attend the discussion, you can write a reflection afterwards to earn points. Details to follow.

### Final Semester Tally

Homework, quizzes, exams, translations, and compositions will add up to a possible maximum of **1,020 points** throughout the semester; points from external events and assignments will be added into your total point pool, equivalent to points earned through the core five assessment types. The following list indicates the point ranges for semester-end grade levels:

925-1020 = A  
850-924 = A-  
800-849 = B+  
750-799 = B  
700-749 = B-  
650-699 = C+  
600-649 = C  
550-599 = C-  
500-549 = D+  
450-499 = D  
< 449 = F

Grades ending in .45 or greater will be rounded up to the nearest whole number; grades ending in .44 or less will be rounded down to the nearest whole number.
