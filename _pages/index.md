## Course Description

This course is the second semester of a year-long introduction to the ancient Greek language, the mode of communication that defines the literature and culture of ancient Greece. Basic familiarity with Greek and the topics introduced in GREK 101 (Introduction to Greek 1) is required. This course will build upon the basics of the Greek language introduced in the first semester (e.g., declension, conjugation, sentence structure, etc.) and eventually build towards a strong command of Greek vocabulary, grammar, and syntax. The goal of first-year Greek is to build a solid foundation for reading actual ancient Greek texts. As such, the acquisition of those linguistic skills, elucidated and practiced through classroom practice and translation and composition exercises, will set a foundation for reading unedited Greek from Sophoclesâ€™ *Oidipous Tyrannos*, a masterpiece of Greek drama.
