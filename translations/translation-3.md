**Instructions**: *Translate the paragraph of Greek below into idiomatic, grammatically-correct English (10 pts.), and answer the grammar and comprehension questions that follow (20 pts.). The grammar in this assignment mostly draws on the concepts in Units 32 through 38 in Mastronarde, but there will be a lot of grammar from previous units as well. Make sure to use the given notes (keyed to words in bold in the text) and the given vocabulary items to help. Any vocabulary that you cannot find in the list below can be found in the Greek-English glossary in Mastronarde (pp. 451-467). Vocabulary in this translation is not limited to the first 38 units of Mastronarde, so there* will *be words used that you will not have memorized yet. This assignment is due* **by 11:59pm on Wednesday, April 14.**

[1] **περὶ πολλοῦ ἂν ποιησαίμην**, ὦ ἄνδρες, **τὸ** **τοιούτους** ὑμᾶς ἐμοὶ δικαστὰς περὶ τούτου τοῦ πράγματος γενέσθαι, **οἷοίπερ** ἂν **ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς** εἴητε, τοιαῦτα **πεπονθότες**. [2] εὖ γὰρ οἶδ᾽ ὅτι, εἰ τὴν **αὐτὴν** γνώμην περὶ τῶν ἄλλων ἔχοιτε, **ἥνπερ** περὶ **ὑμῶν αὐτῶν**, **οὐκ ἂν εἴη ὅστις** οὐκ ἐπὶ τοῖς γεγενημένοις ἀγανακτοίη, ἀλλὰ πάντες ἂν περὶ τῶν τὰ τοιαῦτα ἐπιτηδευόντων τὰς ζημίας μικρὰς **ἡγοῖσθε**. [3] ὦ ἄνδρες, τοῦτό με δεῖ ἐπιδεῖξαι, **ὡς** ἐμοίχευεν Ἐρατοσθένης τὴν γυναῖκα τὴν ἐμὴν καὶ ἐκείνην τε διέφθειρε καὶ τοὺς παῖδας τοὺς ἐμοὺς ᾔσχυνε καὶ ἐμὲ αὐτὸν ὕβρισεν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν τὴν ἐμὴν **εἰσιών**, καὶ οὔτε ἔχθρα ἐμοὶ καὶ ἐκείνῳ **οὐδεμία** ἦν πλὴν ταύτης, οὔτε χρημάτων **ἕνεκα** ἔπραξα ταῦτα, ἵνα πλούσιος **ἐκ πένητος** γένωμαι, **οὔτε ἄλλου κέρδους οὐδενὸς** πλὴν τῆς **κατὰ** τοὺς νόμους τιμωρίας.

### Notes (in order of appearance)

* **περὶ πολλοῦ ἂν ποιησαίμην**: See p. 322 on this idiom (ποιεῖσθαι + περί πολλοῦ), and be careful about the mood of the verb when you translate.
* **τὸ** begins an articular infinitive that stretches to **γενέσθαι**; everything in between belongs to the articular infinitive phrase and forms the object of the verb ποιησαίμην. Translate in this order: "[the fact/idea] that ὑμᾶς γενέσθαι τοιούτους δικαστὰς ἐμοὶ περὶ τούτου τοῦ πράγματος οἷοιπερ ..."
* **τοιούτους ... οἷοιπερ** form a correlative pair, with the latter acting like a relative pronoun: "**such** δικαστὰς ... **as** ...". See p. 321, §6, on the suffix -περ.
* **ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς**: Be careful about your translation here; what kind of pronoun is ὑμῖν αὐτοῖς? Same with **ὑμῶν αὐτῶν** in the next sentence.
* **πεπονθότες**: from πάσχω
* **οἶδ’**: The elided vowel here is alpha: οἶδα
* **αὐτὴν**: What do forms of αὐτός mean when placed in the attributive position? (Hint: see p. 102, §4c.) Compare this against ἐμὲ αὐτὸν in sentence 3; what does it mean there? (Hint: see p. 101, §4b)
* **ἥνπερ**: See p. 321, §6, on the suffix -περ. You have to understand/supply a form of ἔχω in this relative clause: "which [you have]..."
* **οὐκ ἂν εἴη ὅστις**: translate as "there would not be anyone who"
* **ἡγοῖσθε**: ἡγέομαι takes two accusatives, often a noun and an adjective, "to consider [noun] [adjective]" or "to consider [adjective] [noun]." Note that this ἀλλὰ clause is a second apodosis that balances the οὐκ ἂν εἴη clause: "there would not be anyone who ... , but πάντες ἂν ἡγοῖσθε ..."
* **ὡς** begins an indirect statement that explains τοῦτο in the main clause: "... this, (namely) that ...". Note that the indirect statement stretches all the way to the end of the passage.
* **εἰσιών**: present active participle from εἴσειμι, "to go into"
* **οὐδεμία**: Forms of οὐδείς can be both pronouns ("no one") and adjectives ("not any [noun]"). Treat this form as an adjective, and same with **οὐδένος** in the last sentence.
* **ἕνεκα**: Remember that ἕνεκα is a post-positive preposition ("because of" or "for the sake of" + genitive), so you need to look *before* ἕνεκα for its genitive object
* **ἐκ πένητος**: Translate as "from being a poor man"
* **οὔτε ἄλλου κέρδους οὐδενὸς**: Note that this genitive depends on the ἕνεκα before the ἵνα clause: "οὔτε χρημάτων ἕνεκα ... οὔτε ἄλλου κέρδους οὐδένος"
* **κατὰ**: Translate here as "according to" (+ accusative)
